# Key-Helper
A simple AutoHotKey script for auto clicking. Made for lightweight and configless.

# Usage
The script have no gui to show and no config is needed.

- `Right Ctrl + ,` and then click a key to start auto click.
- `Right Ctrl + .` and then click a key to start holding that key. Can be used multiple times to hold many keys.
- `Right Ctrl + /` to stop. May need a little smashing to make sure the script have stopped completely :P
- `Right Ctrl + '` to set click interval.
- `Right Ctrl + \` to shot help message.
- `Right Ctrl + ]` and then click a key to show what key was pressed. (Used to test whether the script is working or not.)
